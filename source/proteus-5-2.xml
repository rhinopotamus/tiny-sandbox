    <p>
        Consider the function defined by the rule
        <me>
            A(x) = \int_{0.5}^x f(t)\, dt
        </me>.
        In the figure below, <m>f(t)</m> is the function graphed in blue, and <m>A(3)</m> is found by computing the area shaded in gray.

                For some small <m>\Delta x</m>, shade in the area corresponding to <m>A(3+\Delta x)</m> on the figure above.

            <p>
                As long as <m>\Delta x</m> is relatively small, <m>\Delta A = A(3+\Delta x) - A(3)</m> is well approximated by a rectangle. Draw such a rectangle on the figure above, and label its height and its width.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Since <m>\Delta A</m> is approximately a rectangle, <m>\Delta A</m> is approximately the product of the height and the width. Use your labels from the previous part to write an approximation for <m>\Delta A</m>.
